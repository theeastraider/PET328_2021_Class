# For pressures above or at bubble point, either pb or rs may be skipped; but not both.
# For pressures below bubble point, only rs may be skipped.
# co is required if pressure is above bubble point; otherwise, it must be skipped.
# A few notes about defaulted parameters pb, rs and co.
    # They are defaulted - hence, users ma skip them when specifying argument values.
    # They are defaulted to None (nothing). So, if a user skip them, what value is used?
    # For co:
            # co is truly optional!
            # It is only needed if value specified for argument pressure is greater than value specified for argument pb
            # If pressure is greater than pb, it is expected that the user has specified value for co
                # That specified co value overides the default value (None) and get used in the computation
            # If pressure is equal to or less than pb, it is expected that the user has not specified value for co
                # In this case, the function does not need co in computation
                # So, co remained defaulted to None and is never used in computation.
    # For pb and rs:
            # They are only optional in the context of argument specification
            # In usage, they are not optional, the function need their values
            # If a user specify their values, the specified value(s) overides the default (None) and get used in computation.
